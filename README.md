# AI/ML Internship Tasks

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

### Task Objective:
The goal of this task was to load and visualize the Iris dataset. We explored various features of the dataset using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to identify patterns and relationships between the features.

### Dataset Used:
- **Dataset**: Iris dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning and statistics.
- **Source**: Seaborn (built-in dataset).

### Models Applied:
- This task focuses solely on data exploration and visualization. No machine learning models were applied.

### Key Results and Findings:
- The scatter plot of petal length vs petal width reveals clear separations between species.
- The histogram shows that the distribution of sepal length is roughly normal.
- The box plot indicates that Iris-setosa has a wider range of sepal width values compared to the other species.
- The pair plot visualizes the relationships between all features, showing strong correlations between some of them.
