# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this task is to load, explore, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and examine the relationships between different features. This involves various visualization techniques to observe the distribution of features and any significant trends.

## Goal:
- Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
- Visualize relationships between different features using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
- Provide insights into the dataset based on the visualizations and statistical summaries.


Dataset Loading and Preprocessing:

# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Loading the Iris dataset from Seaborn
data = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Inspecting the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()


Data Visualization and Exploration:

# Scatter plot to show relationships between petal_length and petal_width
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x='petal_length', y='petal_width', hue='species')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Petal Length vs Petal Width')
plt.show()

# Histogram for the distribution of sepal_length
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(data['sepal_length'], kde=True, color='blue')
plt.title('Distribution of Sepal Length')
plt.show()

# Box plot to examine outliers in sepal width
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='species', y='sepal_width', data=data)
plt.title('Box Plot of Sepal Width by Species')
plt.show()

# Pair plot to visualize all features together
sns.pairplot(data, hue='species')
plt.show()


Explanation of Results and Final Insights:


### Insights from the Scatter Plot:
The scatter plot reveals a clear separation between the three species based on petal length and petal width. This suggests that these two features might be important for distinguishing between species.

### Insights from the Histogram:
The histogram for sepal length shows a roughly normal distribution with a peak around the middle values. This indicates that most of the flowers in the dataset have a medium sepal length.

### Insights from the Box Plot:
The box plot of sepal width by species shows that Iris-setosa has a wider range of sepal width values, while Iris-virginica has more consistent values, suggesting less variation within this species.

### Insights from the Pair Plot:
The pair plot shows the relationships between all features. Petal length and petal width seem to have a stronger correlation, while the other features are more spread out.
